# TODOs
- Migrate FLIR img_save to a nodelet
- Develop scripts to inform us if system is running as expected:
1. Did the Flir driver start successfully
2. Is the CSV being filled out properly
3. Did the Gobi driver start correctly
4. Are pictures being saved to the correct director
5. Did we leave a lense cap on
6. Warn if disk drive is filling up
- Develop a script that makes a symlink from the newest data folder to a folder called latest, much like ros logs. Done 17FEB
- Develop CSV building capability for Gobi


#ROS nodes, launch files, etc. for Bloodhound Gang project (USMA)

This document will show you how to 
1. Access the companion computer, "brix012" on the USMA BHG T650 platform from a groundstation computer running Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.
2. Launch ROS nodes, "bool_pub" and "camera_subscriber", which will allow
3. The toggling of the ROS topic, "record" which indicates whether to start recording images from a FLIR Blackfly camera, which can be mounted to the UAV.
4. Mount the FLIR camera and connect it to the Brix.
------------------------------------------------------
#1. Ground Station to Companion Computer Connection
   
a. Ascertaining the Brix IP Address
   
   If you will be operating with access to a WREN connection on post at West Point, the Brix IP Address will be
   10.212.149.243. 
   Otherwise, if you are operating out of the Robotics Trailer for the first time at a new location do the following.
   - Connect a USB hub to a free USB port on the Brix.
   - Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to this hub.
   - Connect one of the trailer monitors with an HDMI cable.
   - Unplug the power cable running from the Brix to the power distribution board on the UAV, and plug in the Brix adapter
     instead (plug the other end into a wall outlet).
   - Turn on the Brix using the power button on the underside of the computer at the aft, port corner with respect to the
     front of the UAV (blue motors).  Log in using standard RRC credentials.
   - Open a terminal and use the command:  
   
      `ip a`  
   
     You should see a line similar to, "link/ether 00:c0:ca:97:df:c1 brd
     ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff".  Below that, should read "inet" and then a number, for example starting with 10, or 198, or 
     similar.  This is the start of the IP address you want.  Record this in a project/mission notebook.
   
b. Connecting from the Ground Station
   
   - Your ground station computer should be a laptop or desktop running Ubuntu 16.04, or 18.04.  Turn on and log into this machine, and open a terminal.  Enter:  
   
     `ssh [UAV IP]`  
   
     where [UAV IP] will be the address from 1a.  You will be prompted for a password, which will be the RRC standard.  Once 
    logged in, your terminal prompt should read, "user1@brix012", or similar (whatever the name of your companion computer is 
    to the right of the "@".
   
#2. Launching image capture nodes
   - On your ground station computer, in the terminal from 1b., run the command:  
                            
     `roslaunch beginner_tutorials bhg_pub_sub.launch`   
     
     you should be able to tab complete the package and launch file.  If successful, you should see output about the names of 
     the nodes you lauched, and ROS_INFO messages about "Starting Publisher", and then "Number of cameras detected: 1" (if 
     you see 0 instead of 1 here, you may have to restart the launch).  You will then see streaming by, "recordData: 0", 
     which is a message from the subscriber indicating that the topic, "record" has the value "0" right now.  This means no 
     images are being recorded.
  
NOTE: before recording images, or flying, you will want to ensure removal of the FLIR lens cap!

#3. Starting and Stopping Image Recording
   - To start recording images, make sure the terminal in which you did the roslaunch in 2. is active.  Press the "SPACE" 
     bar.  You should see the message scrolling by change to "recordData: 1".
   - To stop recording, press "Q".  The message in the terminal will return to "recordData: 0".  You can toggle back and 
     forth using these two buttons as much as you want.
   - To end the nodes that have been launched, you can use Ctrl-C.
   
#4. Mounting the FLIR
   - Locate the mounting bracket, screws, and washers for mounting.

     <img src="pictures/FLIR_in_Bracket.jpg"
     alt="bracket"
     class="center"
     width="300px"/>
     
   - Insert the camera into the bracket with the "FLIR" logo on the side upsidedown, and screw into place as shown.
     
     <img src="pictures/FLIR_in_Bracket2.jpg"
     alt="bracket insall"
     class="center"
     width="300px"/>
     
   - Plug in USB3 cable into the back of the FLIR, and plug the other end into a spare port (not a hub!) on the companion 
   computer. 
   - Place the bracket between the rails on the battery cage at the bottom of the UAV.  Position the bracket such that the 
     center of the FLIR's lens is as close to centered as possible.  The camera should point 45 degrees downward and toward 
     the front of the craft (blue motors).
   - Screw the bracket into place on the rails.  Beware that the nuts in the top of the bracket may fall out if too much 
   force is applied during installation.
