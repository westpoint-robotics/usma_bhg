# usma_bhg
### TODOs
- Migrate FLIR img_save to a nodelet
- Develop scripts to inform us if system is running as expected:
1. Did the Flir driver start successfully
2. Is the CSV being filled out properly
3. Did the Gobi driver start correctly
4. Are pictures being saved to the correct director
5. Did we leave a lense cap on
6. Warn if disk drive is filling up
7. Develop a script that makes a symlink from the newest data folder to a folder called latest, much like ros logs. Done 17FEB
8. Develop CSV building capability for Gobi

# Ubuntu: Image Restore or Installation
### a. Option 1: Full Sysem Image
- Use Clonezilla to image the development Companion Computer. You will be taking the steps to [Restore](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live-doc.php) an image, but it will be device-device, rather than device-image. 
   
### b. Option 2: From a clean install of Ubuntu
- Follow the instructions at: https://github.com/westpoint-robotics/os-setup/blob/master/ubuntu18_bhg.md
- Follow the instructions in part "c. Option3" below. 

### c. Option 3: From a computer with ROS already installed
- Use Clonezilla to burn an image with Ubuntu 18.04.  You will be taking the steps to [Restore](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live-doc.php) an image, but it will be device-device, rather than device-image.

# Additonal installs for MAVProxy to work:
`sudo apt-get update`    #Update the list of packages in the software center  
`sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-opencv python3-wxgtk3.0 libxml2-dev python3-pip python3-matplotlib python3-lxml python-pip python3-pip`  
`sudo pip3 install future`  
`sudo pip3 install pymavlink`  
`sudo pip3 install mavproxy`  

# FTDI wiring.  
- The FTDI adapter did not work as wired. I had to switch rx and tx wires for this to work with ardupilot. Now the rx pin on the pixhawk is wired to the rx pin on the FT232 and the same with the tx pin.

# Install the latest QGroundControl on Ubuntu 18.04
- Install dependencies:
`sudo apt-get install libqt5serialport5 qml-module-qtquick2 qtdeclarative5-qtquick2-plugin gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav`
- Remove modemmanager:
`sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y`
- Download: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/latest/QGroundControl.AppImage
- `chmod +x ./QGroundControl.AppImage`
- Download: https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/APMPlanner/apm_planner_2.0.26_xenial64.deb
- Install it with:
`sudo dpkg -i apm_planner_2.0.26_xenial64.deb`

# Mavros not working Totally
- Mavros was publishing diagnostits but no other topics. Running the below command fixed this:
`rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1`
- This is now incorporated in the ardupilot.launch node and appears to work from there.

# Web server and ROS    
- `sudo apt-get install python-tornado python-bson ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite  ros-melodic-roswww`
- `roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch`

## Experimental below here:
- curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
- sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
- node --version
- npm --version
solves problem of eventemitter2 missing on local computer

### Solve the nagging error of: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module" 
- `sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module`

### Missing dependencies
- `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-libsensors-monitor`
- `sudo -H pip3 install --upgrae pip`
- `sudo -H pip3 install matplotlib`
- `sudo -H pip3 install jupyter`
