# This document will show you how to:
1. Connect your ground station computer to your UAV companion computer network.
2. Launch image capturing ROS nodes.
3. Start and stop recording from FLIR and Xeneth Gobi cameras.
4. Mount the FLIR camera (Gobi follows suit).
------------------------------------------------------
## Definitions
- Ground Station: Any station on the ground that communicates with UAS.
- Ground Control Station (GCS): The one station that recieves telemetry data from the UAS flight controller and is capable of sending missions and commands to the flight controller.
- Companion Computer: The computer that is part of the UAS. It is physically mounted on the UAS and is capable of communicating with the Flight Controller
- Pilot-in-Command (PIC): The PIC has the final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight. He/She is also the person who can operate (manipulate controls) the UAS if need be.

## 1. Ground Station to Companion Computer communication

### Ground Station Computers
- The preferred method is to use two computers and two operators for the ground stations. 
     - One computer runs the Ground Control Station software and is primarily used to monitor the flight mission and conditions. This station is considered critical to safe operations.
     - Another computer is used to establish an ssh shell to the companion computer. This shell is used to start, stop, and monitor the BHG software running on the companion computer. This is critical to successful completion of mission related tasks. 
     - The priority for monitoring ground station computers should remain on the Ground Control Station. Ideally one person is fully commited to operating the Ground Control Station while a second person operates the other ground station with the shell.
     - We can always refly the mission task as long as we fly safe, whereas an un-safe flight is likely to ground us for a prolonged period of time. 
     - It is not a requirement to maintain continous ability to control the UAS from the GCS but the PIC needs to be made aware when this ability is lost.

### Ground Control Station connection to UAS Flight Control Unit
- This is done with a telemetery radio mounted on the UAS and a matching telemetry radio connected by USB to the Ground Control Station.
- When properly configured, the telemetry radios automatically connect to each other upon powering up.
- QGround Control or Mission Planner software is used on the Ground Control Station  

### Other Ground Station computers to the UAS Companion Computer.    
- The companion computer will by default boot and log into the OS when power is applied.
- After the OS loads, it will automatically create a wireless access point with an SSID of 'nuc##' where ## is the NUC number.
- Once the access point becomes visible on the graound station, connect to it, and provide the password. 
- The IP address for the companion will always be 10.42.0.1.
- To find the IP address of the ground station, use the below command:  
    `ip a`  
- To open a remote shell on the companion computer use SSH:  
    `ssh user1@10.42.0.1`

------------------------------------------------------   
## 2. Launching bhg software

- On your ground station computer open a remote shell on the companion computer:  
    `ssh user1@10.42.0.1`   
- In the remote shell start the software:  
     `roslaunch usma_bhg master.launch`   
    or use the alias:  
    `bhg_launch`  
- If successful, you should see output about the names of the nodes you launched, and ROS_INFO messages about "Starting Publisher"
- Watch for any red error text to stream by. If it does investigate it. 
- If everything works as expected, there should be no red text; however, it is common for the Pixhawk to generate red text if it is failing PreArm checks. This is not a failure of nodes to start, and no action in the terminal is required. The messages look like this:
<pre>
[ERROR] [1593401054.831960641]: FCU: PreArm: fence requires position
[ERROR] [1593401054.832934034]: FCU: PreArm: Throttle below Failsafe
[ERROR] [1593401054.832957058]: FCU: PreArm: Waiting for 3D fix
</pre>
### Check if both cameras started completed
- If both cameras started completely, you would see a message for the Gobi and a message for the FLIR appear about every 30 seconds stating the number of pictures taken and the amount saved. They look this:
<pre>
[ INFO] [1593401045.704584516]: ***** GOBI:  Grabbed Image 183, and saved 0
[INFO] [1593401061.708994]:     ***** FLIR:  Grabbed Image 602, and saved 0
</pre>
- Typically the FLIR camera starts operating before the GOBI and will have a higher image count.

### Trigger Signal
- Both cameras receive an external trigger signal to synchronize the pictures. Tests have shown that aproximately 70% of the images are taken within 1ms of each other and greater than 90% of the images are taken within 2ms of each other.
- The trigger signal is sent at 20hz with a 50% duty cycle using an Arduino Trinket. 
- The frequency can be changed by modifying the 'hz' variable in the Arduino source code. 
- The Arduino source code can be found in this repo in the 'resources' sub-directory. 

### Some common failures - indicators, causes, and fixes:
1. The FLIR takes pictures at a much slower rate (1-3 hz as oppossed to 20 hz) and the pictures are solid grey.  
    - INDICATOR: The rate of change in the number of pictures taken as shown in the terminal is very low for the FLIR
    - CAUSE: Unkown
    - FIX: This requires disconnecting the USB3 cable from the camera to the Companion Computer and replugging it in, to reboot the camera.
    - FREQUENCY: This is one of the more frequent failures that occurs. When this happens the pictures tend to be just gray images. 
2. The GOBI fails to take images  
    - INDICATOR: The terminal window will only show that the FLIR grabbed images. No messages appear for the GOBI.
    - CAUSE: Unkown, likely caused by the GOBI not closing cleanly from the previous run. 
    - FIX: Sometimes restarting the software solves this, other times it requires power cycling the GOBI.
    - FREQUENCY: This is one of the more frequent failures that occurs. 
3. Either camera starts but does not take pictures  
    - INDICATOR: In the terminal window you see repeatedly the messages below:
     <pre>
     [INFO] [1593440380.007396]: ***** FLIR:  Error: Spinnaker: Failed waiting for EventData on NEW_BUFFER_DATA event. [-1011]
     [ INFO] [1593440341.820839985]: ***** GOBI:  Retrieve frame timed out waiting for frame (possibly not triggered), Code 10008.
     </pre>
     - CAUSE: Cameras not receiving the trigger signal.
     - FIX: Check the wiring to and from the Arduino. If only one camera shows this error and the cables appear to be ok, then power cycle the camera and restart the software.
     - FREQUENCY: Usually a hardware problem and once fixed this error does not appear again.

------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Starting and Stopping Image Recording

- All commands in this section are run in a remote shell to the companion computer.
- Both cameras take pictures upon the start of the software and publish them as rostopics in the camera namespace.
    - FLIR Topic is: `/camera/image_color`
    - GOBI Topic is: `/camera/gobi_image`
- The images are saved only after receiving a `/record` topic set to true and stopped when the topic is published with a value of false.
- The `/record` topic is published as true automatically when the pixhawk enters 'AUTO' mode. It stops when the pixhawk leaves 'AUTO' mode.
- The `/record` topic is published as true when the switch on channel 9 is toggled back toward the user and false when toggled away from the user.
- The `/record` topic can also be published by command line using the alias or typing out the command.
    - Alias:
        - `bhg_start`
        - `bhg_stop`
    - Command:
        - `rostopic pub -1 /record std_msgs/Bool True`
        - `rostopic pub -1 /record std_msgs/Bool False` 
        
## NOTE: Before recording images, or flying: REMOVE THE LENS CAPS!
------------------------------------------------------   
## 4. Mounting the FLIR
   - Locate the mounting bracket, screws, and washers for mounting.
     
     <img src="pictures/Bracket_to_Battery-Cage.jpg"
     alt="screws and washers"
     class="center"
     width="300px"/>
     <img src="pictures/FLIR_in_Bracket.jpg"
     alt="bracket"
     class="center"
     width="300px"/>
     
   - Insert the camera into the bracket with the "FLIR" logo on the side upsidedown, and screw into place as shown.
     
     <img src="pictures/FLIR_in_Bracket2.jpg"
     alt="bracket insall"
     class="center"
     width="300px"/>
     
   - Plug in USB3 cable into the back of the FLIR, and plug the other end into a spare port (not a hub!) on the companion 
   computer. 
   - Place the bracket between the rails on the battery cage at the bottom of the UAV.  Position the bracket such that the 
     center of the FLIR's lens is as close to centered as possible.  The camera should point 45 degrees downward and toward 
     the front of the craft (blue motors).
   - Screw the bracket into place on the rails.  Beware that the nuts in the top of the bracket may fall out if too much 
   force is applied during installation.

## 5. Reliably move files to external disk:
- Use rsynch command:  
    - Command is rsync  -av --info=progress2 SOURCE DESTINATION  
    `rsync -av --info=progress2 ~/Data/* /media/user1/BHG_USMA01/BHG_DATA/`  

# Nodes
### dir_setup node
- Directory Setup Node
#### Params   
- None  
#### Published Topics  
- `directory` (std_msgs::String): This is the name of the parent directory to save all files in. This is called the mission directory in the code. By default it starts with the data directory ("/home/user1/Data/") plus a date time stamp. An example: /home/user1/Data/20210508_170124_036/.
- `gobi_fc` (std_msgs::Int32): This is the number of files in the gobi or boson directory.
- `flir_fc` (std_msgs::Int32): This is the number of files in the balckfly directory.
#### Subscribed Topics
- `/record` (std_msgs::Bool): If this is true it signals the camera nodes to start saving pictures. If false it signals the camera nodes to stop saving pictures to file.

### flir_oop.py node
- FLIR Blackfly camera control code. This code gets the images from the camera and controls the cameras behaviors. If recording the node save to file its images into the mission directory and records meta data of the image into a csv file also located in the mission directory.
- PROBLEM, FX: If no trigger there is about a 1 - 2 second lag in the time stamp on the image and the actual time the image was taken.
#### Params
- `camera/flir/multi_threaded` true or false. Better performance with false
- `camera/flir/trigger_mode` hardware, software or none. Tested with hardware and none only.
#### Published Topics 
- `image_color` (sensor_msgs::Image) the colored image captured from the camera as bgr8.
#### Subscribed Topics
- `/directory` (std_msgs::String): This is the mission directory to save files into.
- `/record` (std_msgs::Bool): If true the node saves files to disk otherwise it does not.
- `/mavros/altitude` (mavros_msgs::Altitude): Altitude used to record to csv file.
- `/mavros/global_position/raw/fix` (sensor_msgs::NavSatFix): Altitude used to record to csv file.
- `/mavros/imu/mag` (sensor_msgs::MagneticField): Magnetic heading used to record to csv file.
- `/mavros/imu/data` (sensor_msgs::Imu): IMU readings used to record to csv file.
- `/mavros/global_position/raw/gps_vel` (geometry_msgs::TwistStamped): Velocity used to record to csv file.
- `/mavros/imu/temperature_imu` (sensor_msgs::Temperature): Temperature used to record to csv file.


------------------------------------------------------   
# BELOW HERE NEEDS UPDATING
- Cameras are now fully operational with running "master.launch". Previously Gobi would not take pictures until record was 'true'. Now both Gobi and Flir publish pictures upon starting master.luanch. They both listen for the topic "/record" to be true to start saving images or false to stop saving images.
- master.launch and img_capture.launch have a set of bool args at the top of the file. These allow disabling or enabling the running of different components fo the system. This eliminates the copy and paste of comments to achieve this.
- A new node call record.mux is created. This node listens for any change in th "F" switch on the DX9. If the switch changes and into any position but position "0" it publishes record = true, if it is changed to the "0" position it publishes record = false. This node only publishes once upon a switch change.
- It is recommended to use the below commands to start and stop record from command line. They will publish one time only. This is all that is required to make the change.  
`rostopic pub -1 /record std_msgs/Bool True`  
`rostopic pub -1 /record std_msgs/Bool False`   

## 5. Disk cleanup and maintenance tasks added:
### The file dir_setup.py uses the file dir_cleanup.py to do the following Data directory tasks:
- It removes any folders with less then 5 files in it. It is assumed these folders are unused data directories
- If the symlink is broken by this removal it recreates to point to the last used directory.
- It moves the Bagfile to the last used folder.
- All this is done after rosshutdown is triggered.

# TODO
- Automatically copy the flight log into the data directory.
- Use Gui to create log entries for flight, things like direction of camera, angle camera, alti, flight plan
